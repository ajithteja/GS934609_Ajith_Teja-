GSynergy React Project

📌 Project Overview

This is a React-based project using Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It features an interactive UI with AG Grid, React Router, and reusable components for an efficient development experience.

🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Prerequisites

Node.js (Latest LTS recommended)

npm (or yarn/pnpm as package manager)

2️⃣ Installation & Running the Project

# Clone the repository

git clone <repo-url>

# Navigate into the project folder

cd gs_react

# Install dependencies

npm install

# Start the development server

npm run dev

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173/.

3️⃣ Building the Project

npm run build

This compiles the TypeScript files and bundles the app for production.

4️⃣ Running Lint Checks

npm run lint

This ensures the code follows best practices and consistent formatting.

✅ Features Implemented Successfully

🔹 AG Grid for Dynamic Tables

Implemented AG Grid React for handling large datasets efficiently.

Added dynamic column formatting, sorting, filtering, and editing capabilities.

🔹 Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

Fully responsive sidebar, navbar, and tables.

Custom styles applied using index.css for consistency.

🔹 React Router for Navigation

Implemented a structured routing system with React Router v7.

Sidebar navigation updates dynamically based on the selected route.

🔹 Optimized State Management

Used useState and useRef for managing grid data and UI interactions.

Implemented controlled components for handling form inputs and validation.

These elements demonstrate my ability to build a scalable, efficient, and well-structured React application.

⏳ What Could Be Improved with 4 More Hours?

🛠 Code Enhancements & Performance Optimizations

Lazy Loading & Code Splitting: Improve performance by loading only required components on demand.

Better Error Handling: Implement error boundaries and toast notifications for improved user feedback.

Unit & Integration Tests: Write Jest & React Testing Library tests for components to ensure reliability.

Enhance Type Safety: Improve TypeScript typings for AG Grid and global state management.

These improvements would make the app more robust, maintainable, and scalable.

💡 Feedback on the Challenge

The challenge was well-structured and covered frontend performance, state management, and UI responsiveness.

Could include API integration tasks to test async data fetching and caching.

💬 Thanks for the opportunity! Looking forward to any feedback or further enhancements! 🚀
